# Why We Fight Over the Same God

*A book exploring the psychology behind religious conflicts despite shared beliefs in one God*

## About This Book

This book examines one of humanity's greatest ironies: how billions of people who worship the same God, trace their faith back to the same father (Abraham), and share remarkably similar values, have spent centuries in conflict over their differences rather than celebrating their unity.

## Key Questions We Explore

- How did Abraham's family dynamics create three major world religions?
- Why do people who believe in the same God fight over whose interpretation is "correct"?
- What psychological mechanisms turn religious unity into division?
- How does this pattern show up beyond religion in politics, nationalism, and everyday life?
- Can we break this cycle of conflict?

## Repository Structure
