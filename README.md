# Why We Fight Over the Same God

*A book exploring the psychology behind religious conflicts despite shared beliefs in one God*

## 📖 About This Book

This book examines one of humanity's greatest ironies: how billions of people who worship the same God, trace their faith back to the same father (Abraham), and share remarkably similar values, have spent centuries in conflict over their differences rather than celebrating their unity.

**Central Question**: Why do Jews, Christians, and Muslims—who agree on 90% of everything—spend so much energy fighting over the remaining 10%?

**Unique Approach**: Psychology-focused rather than theological; respectful to all traditions while examining universal human patterns that extend far beyond religion.

## 🎬 Chapter Highlights

### Chapter 1: One Father, Three Religions
> *"Poor Abraham. He just wanted to be obedient to God and have some kids in his old age. He became the father of nations, all right. He also accidentally became the grandfather of humanity's longest-running family feud."*

**Explores**: How Abraham's family drama became the foundation for Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and why sibling rivalry scaled to civilizational proportions feels so familiar.

### Chapter 2: Same God, Different Books  
> *"Three people praying to the same God, each convinced the others are wrong."*

**Explores**: The shocking similarities between the three faiths and why humans focus on 10% differences instead of 90% commonalities.

### Chapter 3: Us vs. Them - The Tribal Brain
> *"Why a jersey color can make strangers into enemies"*

**Explores**: The evolutionary psychology behind group loyalty, from sports fans to religious communities, and why proximity often breeds conflict.

### Chapter 4: The Need to Be Right
> *"Why admitting uncertainty feels like losing faith"*

**Explores**: Cognitive dissonance, confirmation bias, and terror management theory—the psychological forces that make religious certainty feel like survival.

## 💡 Key Insights So Far

> "The closer two groups are, the more they emphasize small differences to maintain distinct identities."

> "We're using Stone Age psychology to navigate Space Age religious diversity, and the results are often destructive rather than adaptive."

> "Religious certainty usually breaks down gradually rather than suddenly, and the people with the loudest certainty are often those struggling most with doubt."

> "It's as if three siblings inherited the same family values but spent all their time arguing over who Dad loved most, instead of working together to honor what he taught them."

*"The question that haunts us 4,000 years later is this: Is it possible for Abraham's children to remember what their father actually taught them? Can siblings who've been fighting for millennia learn to see their shared inheritance instead of their competitive differences?"*

**The answer to that question might determine whether Abraham's legacy becomes a blessing or a curse for the next 4,000 years.**
