### **Do This Instead:**
- ✅ **Set timer** - Write for focused 90-minute blocks
- ✅ **Follow the outline** - Trust the structure you built
- ✅ **Tell stories first** - Psychology follows naturally
- ✅ **Track small wins** - Every paragraph counts
- ✅ **Celebrate progress** - You're doing something amazing
